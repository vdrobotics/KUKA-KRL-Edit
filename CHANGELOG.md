# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

---

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Fold/unfold actions are now bundled in a single "Folding" submenu in the editor context menu of KRL files: fold/unfold at cursor (also recursively), fold/unfold all blocks, and "Fold All ;FOLD Blocks" / "Unfold All ;FOLD Blocks" for the KUKA `;FOLD … ;ENDFOLD` regions. The commands are also available in the Command Palette under the "KUKA KRL" category while a KRL file is active.
- The folding commands carry the standard VS Code folding shortcuts (`Ctrl+Shift+[` / `Ctrl+Shift+]`, `Ctrl+K Ctrl+0` / `Ctrl+K Ctrl+J`, `Ctrl+K Ctrl+8` / `Ctrl+K Ctrl+9`, …) scoped to KRL files, so the context menu shows the matching shortcut next to every entry.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-31
### Added
- Bundled index of KUKA `$`-system variables (`server/data/system_vars.json`, ~445 entries). Typing `$` now offers system-variable completions (with data type and description), and hovering over a `$`-variable shows its type and description.

### Changed
- `kukaKrl.validation.undeclaredIdentifiers` is now enabled by default and no longer marked experimental. It still emits Information-severity diagnostics for identifiers not found in the current KRL workspace index. (`$`-system variables, `#`-enums and `.`-subvariables remain exempt, so an incomplete system-variable index never causes false "undeclared" warnings.)
- Renamed the settings category title from "KUKA KRL Assistant" to "KUKA KRL Edit".
- Normalized the system-variable index: consistent data types (`Integer`, `Real`, `Boolean`, `Structure`, `Frame`, `Enum`, `Signal`, `Array`, `Character`) and cleaned-up descriptions (OCR artefacts, stray quotes and split compound words).
- Migrated the TypeScript build to `module`/`moduleResolution` `node16` (the deprecated `node`/`node10` resolution is removed in TypeScript 7.0). CommonJS output is unchanged.

### Fixed
- Resolved the deprecation error reported for `"moduleResolution": "node"` in `client/tsconfig.json` / `server/tsconfig.json`.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- Function-name lookup now compares names case-insensitively and ignores whitespace during matching, so `DEF`/`DEFFCT` declarations, hover, go-to-definition, and undeclared-identifier validation use the same KRL-style lookup behavior.
- Escaped symbol names in reference and declaration lookups before building regular expressions.
- Multi-root VS Code workspaces now keep function and declaration indexes scoped per workspace folder, preventing similarly structured KRL projects from interfering with each other.

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- New `kukaKrl.validation.variableNameSyntax` diagnostic. It reports invalid KRL variable identifiers in declarations, including names that do not start with a letter, names containing unsupported characters, and names that reuse reserved KRL keywords or predefined types.
- New experimental `kukaKrl.validation.undeclaredIdentifiers` diagnostic. It reports identifiers that are not declared in the current KRL workspace index as Information and is disabled by default.

### Fixed
- Variable-name validation now respects array brackets when splitting declaration lists, so declarations like `DECL INT arr[2,3], nextVar` are parsed correctly.
- Variable-name validation no longer reports valid machine-data system variable declarations like `DECL ADAP_ACC $ADAP_ACC=#STEP2`.
- Variable-name validation now treats `CONST` as a declaration modifier, so declarations like `DECL CONST CHAR MASREF_Modulname[6]` validate the actual variable name.
- Variable-name validation no longer treats KRL keywords/types as invalid variable names, because valid machine data can use names like `LOAD_DATA`, `OUT`, or `ERR`.
- `&` metadata lines such as `&COMMENT global points` are ignored by diagnostics.
- Experimental undeclared-identifier validation was hardened against real KUKA project data: direct `.dat` type declarations, common KRL system commands/functions, structure initializers, and single-quoted bit literals now avoid false positives.
- Added more KRL system commands/functions to the undeclared-identifier allow-list, including `REPEAT`, `UNTIL`, `PTP_REL`, `SWRITE`, and `ERR_RAISE`.
- Undeclared-identifier validation now builds a workspace-wide declaration index from `.src`, `.dat`, and `.sub` files, so cross-file array declarations such as `DECL KORREKTUR Korr_GT3_RS_16818_Dross[3]` are resolved in function calls.
- Added `IntToStrWithPrefix()` and `GET_COLLMON_SET()` to the undeclared-identifier allow-list.

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-08
### Added
- Four `kukaKrl.validation.*` settings to toggle individual diagnostics on or off, all defaulting to `true`:
  - `variableNameLength` — 24-character variable name limit (Error)
  - `globalUsage` — `GLOBAL` keyword usage check (Warning)
  - `defdatPublicGlobalRequired` — `DEFDAT … PUBLIC` requires `GLOBAL` declarations (Warning)
  - `defdatNonPublicGlobalForbidden` — non-PUBLIC `DEFDAT` forbids `GLOBAL` declarations (Error)

  Toggling a setting clears stale diagnostics across open files immediately, no reload required. The two server-side toggles (`defdat*`) are pushed to the language server via a `custom/setValidationConfig` notification.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Folding ranges for KRL block constructs: `DEF`/`DEFFCT`/`DEFDAT`, `IF`, `LOOP`, `FOR`, `WHILE`, `SWITCH`, `STRUC` and `REPEAT`. Also folds the KUKA-style `;FOLD … ;ENDFOLD` editor blocks that appear in machine-generated code.
- Recognize uppercase file extensions `.SRC`, `.DAT` and `.SUB` in addition to the lowercase variants — KUKA controllers commonly produce uppercase filenames.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Find All References (`Shift+F12`, right-click → "Find All References" / "Go to References", peek view via `Alt+Shift+F12`). Case-insensitive workspace-wide search across `.src`, `.dat` and `.sub` files. Skips line comments, subvariable accesses (`foo.bar`) and system variables (`$foo`, `#foo`). Honors the LSP `includeDeclaration` flag.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Document Symbols / Outline support for `DEF`, `DEFFCT` and `DEFDAT` blocks. Functions and data modules now appear in the Outline view, in Breadcrumbs, and via the symbol picker (Ctrl+Shift+O).

### Fixed
- `Go to Definition` failed when the symbol was written with a different case than its declaration. KRL is case-insensitive, but variable, struct and function lookups compared names strictly. Now all lookups are case-insensitive, and the jump position is computed correctly even when the file uses a different casing than the call site.

---

## [1.4.6] - 2025-08-24
### Fixed
- Fix issue with variables that could contain the string "Global" and trigger the PUBLIC DEFDAT error.

---

---

## [1.4.2] - 2025-07-28
